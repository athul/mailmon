# Mailmon
MailMon is an Mass Emailer with a Vue Frontend and a Go Backend(Gin) and uses SendGrid's API to send emails to groups of People.

Mailmon is made and currently used for a sending emails to all students in My class and for educational purposes. 

## Using it
Since sending emails to many people take quite some time and server's power to compute. It's better that you use it locally.
- Clone the Project
#### Frontend

- `$ cd frontend`
- Use Yarn or Npm to install the dependencies
```bash
$ yarn install
# OR
$ npm install
```
- Build the Files
```bash
$ yarn build
#OR
$ npm run build
```
This command will generate static(HTML,CSS and JS) files which will be used by the server to show the webpage like below

#### Server
- Install Go and do the setup
- run `go mod download` to download the dependencies
- Run the server

```bash
$ go run main.go # to run the server 
# OR
$ go build main.go # generates static binary
$ ./main # Execute the binary
```

A server will start at port [8080](http://localhost:8080). The `/` endpoint will show our frontend.

#### SendGrid

- Create a SendGrid Account and Create an API Key
- Save the API Key as a environment variable as `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
  
```bash
$ export SENDGRID_API_KEY = <api_key>
```
